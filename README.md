ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ Storytelling View
	1.	Overall Sales Performance
	â€¢	The company achieved a total sales revenue of 465K, which sets the stage for analyzing how this revenue is distributed across time, regions, products, and customers.

  
  
  2.	Sales Trends Over Time (Line Chart: Sales Amount by Sale_Date & Channel)
	â€¢	Looking at the sales trend, we see frequent fluctuations throughout the year.
	â€¢	Both Online and Retail channels contribute consistently, but neither shows a smooth upward trend, suggesting demand is highly variable and may depend on promotions, seasonality, or external factors.

  
  3.	Regional and Product Contribution (Stacked Bar: Region & Product_Category)
	â€¢	The East region leads in total sales, while South lags slightly behind.
	â€¢	Across all regions, Clothing and Furniture dominate sales, while Electronics consistently underperform.
	â€¢	This signals strong demand in lifestyle categories but highlights an opportunity (or challenge) in electronics sales.

  
  4.	Top Product Categories (Horizontal Bar: Product_Category)
	â€¢	Furniture and Clothing are almost neck and neck, driving the bulk of sales.
	â€¢	Food follows closely, while Electronics remains the weakest, confirming the regional analysis.
	â€¢	Businesses should consider investing more in high-performing categories while revisiting pricing, promotions, or positioning for electronics.

  
  
  5.	Customer Type Contribution (Donut Chart: New vs Returning)
	â€¢	Interestingly, New customers contribute 56% of total sales, while Returning customers contribute 44%.
	â€¢	This balance is healthy, showing the company is both attracting fresh buyers and retaining a loyal base.
	â€¢	However, focusing on strategies to convert new customers into repeat buyers could significantly boost long-term growth.
